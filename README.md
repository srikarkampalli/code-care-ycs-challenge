# CodeCare: Addressing SDGs 8,9, and 11 with AI-powered mobile clinic routing

This is the official submission by Srikar Kampalli for the Young Coders' Sphere Code for Cities Competition, where I bulid an AI-powered routing system for mobile clinics.

The risk model had an RMSE of ~0.05 and an R^2 score of ~0.97, and the GUI works for the Missouri case.

Run the data analysis scripts in this order: clean_hospital_data.py, correlation_analysis.py, (then the risk model) create_mo_dataset.py, process_risk_nodes.py (and then the GUI).
